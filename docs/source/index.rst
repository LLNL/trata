Welcome to the LLNL Trata Documentation!
====================================================

Trata
=====

Trata is used to generate sample points in order to explore a parameter space.
For instance, if a simulation takes two inputs, x and y, and you want to run a set of simulations with x-values
between 5 and 20 and y-values between 0.1 and 1000, the sampling component can generate sample points (which in
this case means (x,y) pairs) for you. You can specify how many total sample points you want, and how you want
them to be chosen--the sampling component offers a large number of different sampling strategies.
If, on the other hand, you already have sample points you wish to use,
the component can simply read them in from a file.


The ``trata`` package works with Python 3 and is made up of 3 modules:
   * ``sampler``
   * ``composite_samples``
   * ``adaptive_samples``

On LC RZ and CZ systems, ``trata`` is available in the weave-develop environment. You can activate the weave-develop environment by running:

::

         source /usr/apps/weave/weave-develop/bin/activate
 
Demo usage:

.. code:: python

         from trata import composite_samples

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :hidden:
